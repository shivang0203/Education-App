# education_app

Our App is based on the DATA STRUCTURES course CS102 that we studied in second
Semester. In our app we tried to explain the concepts of Searching and Sorting through
animation until now (further we will be explaining all the concepts as well) and we explained
two Searching and four Sorting algorithms through animation.
Searching Algorithms :-
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
Sorting Algorithms
1. Selection Sort
2. Quick Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Bubble Sort
Further we also provided a feature where the user can test his or her knowledge of
concepts by attempting quiz. The quizzes can be created by teacher also to conduct tests.
We have also provided resources for all topic in PDF format where the conceptual
explanation as well as the Codes are available for the user.
